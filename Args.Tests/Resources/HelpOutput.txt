<command> FileName [/Id|/I] [/Name|/N] [/Switch|/S] [/Date|/Da] [/Work|/W] 
          [/Descripton|/De]


FileName              The name of the file
[/Id|/I]              This is the Id
[/Name|/N]            This is the name you should put in. This is an extremely 
                      long description that should take multiple lines to 
                      output. The formating should still be maintained and 
                      should look good in the output.
[/Switch|/S]          Force it!
[/Date|/Da]           Effective date
[/Descripton|/De]     aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
